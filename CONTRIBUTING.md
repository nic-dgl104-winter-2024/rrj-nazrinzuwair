### Desciption
The [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) initiative aims to simplify and make it easier for newcomers to contribute to open-source projects by streamlining and facilitating the procedure. Whether you're new to coding or looking for your first project contribution experience, this effort seeks to offer contributors a clear advice and help at every stage.

"First Contributions" takes a user-friendly approach, providing simple steps that lead beginners through the process of making their first contribution easy. The project makes complicated procedures easier to understand and guarantees that newcomers have the confidence to engage with the open-source community with features like forking repositories and pull request submission.

The project is noteworthy for its enormous translation effort, since the README.md has been translated into 76 different languages. Through the use of many languages, the project is made more inclusive and accessible, allowing people from a variety of linguistic backgrounds to participate and contribute for the first time.
