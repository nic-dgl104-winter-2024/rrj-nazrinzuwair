# Open Source Community Contribution

## Contribution for First Contributions 

### Desciption
The [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) initiative aims to simplify and make it easier for newcomers to contribute to open-source projects by streamlining and facilitating the procedure. Whether you're new to coding or looking for your first project contribution experience, this effort seeks to offer contributors a clear advice and help at every stage.

"First Contributions" takes a user-friendly approach, providing simple steps that lead beginners through the process of making their first contribution easy. The project makes complicated procedures easier to understand and guarantees that newcomers have the confidence to engage with the open-source community with features like forking repositories and pull request submission.

The project is noteworthy for its enormous translation effort, since the README.md has been translated into 76 different languages. Through the use of many languages, the project is made more inclusive and accessible, allowing people from a variety of linguistic backgrounds to participate and contribute for the first time.


### Summary of the Identified Issue:

The issue I examined was [issue 62077](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/issues/62077), which involves adding translations for the cli-tool-tutorials. While the README.md file has been translated into 76 languages, the cli-tool-tutorials, serving as a crucial guide for first-time contributors navigating the terminal, currently lacks translations in languages beyond Spanish, Hindi, Urdu, and French. Despite the issue being opened on December 25, 2022, with its last commit made on July 25, 2023, there has been limited active contribution from contributors in making translations available.


### Approach To Solving The Issue

To address this issue, I will focus on the language used by Sri Lankans, which is Sinhala. The reason for choosing this language is that it is my native language, and I am proficient in it. The steps that I will follow in addressing the issue are as follows:

   1. First, I will carefully review the content of the cli-tool-tutorials, ensuring a thorough understanding of the intended message.
   2. Next, I will proceed to translate the content into Sinhala.
   3. Finally, I will meticulously proofread the text to eliminate any grammatical errors and ensure clarity and accuracy.


### My Fork of the First Contributions Project

Explore my forked version of the Cli-Tool-Tutorial Sinhala translation [here](https://github.com/nazrinzuwair/first-contributions/tree/cli-tool-tutorial-sinhala-translation). I've taken the initiative to translate the content into Sinhala, aiming to make it more accessible to a broader audience.

### Summary Of Peer Code Review


### Translation Challenges and Strategy used

The translation process posed significant challenges, particularly when encountering technical terms that proved complex to translate into Sinhala. Consequently, I opted to retain certain terms in their original form. This decision was motivated by the recognition that familiarity with these terms in their English form aids readers in understanding the content and its associated processes, especially given the prevalence of English terminology within GitHub's interface and documentation.


## Reflection

Contributing to an open-source project through translation has been an enlightening experience. It has not only deepened my understanding of the essential criteria for contribution but has also provided valuable insights into accessing crucial project information. Through this process, I have gained proficiency in fundamental tasks like forking, cloning, creating branches, and submitting changes for review. This journey has not only expanded my technical skills but has also instilled in me a greater appreciation for the collaborative nature of open-source communities and the importance of clear project documentation.
