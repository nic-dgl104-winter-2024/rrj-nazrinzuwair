# Week 8 - Research and Reflection Journal

## Day 1 - 26th February 2024

### RESEARCH A NEW LANGUAGE

Lua is an embeddable scripting language and is popular for its powerful and lightweight features. Lua has been used in many industrial applications, such as Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom, and in embedded systems like the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil (Lua, 2024). Additionally, Lua is prominently featured in many famous games, such as World of Warcraft and Angry Birds. Lua also facilitates rapid modifications to basic systems, existing applications, or hardware (Stieg, 2022). Furthermore, Lua is increasingly used in network programming, such as in CISCO Systems, Nmap, and ModSecurity, to enhance overall performance and create advanced functionalities. It plays a major role in scripting tasks, including automation, file manipulation, and web scraping, often combined with other languages to  craft tailored applications  (Wambua, 2022).

There are many valuable online resources available for learning Lua. Some of my favorite websites include:

  - [Lua.org](https://www.lua.org/home.html) - Lua's official website, providing comprehensive documentation and resources.
  - [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/index.htm) - Tutorialspoint offers a detailed Lua tutorial covering various aspects of the language.
  - [Lua Learning](https://www.lualearning.org/) - Lua Learning organization provides interactive tutorials and resources for beginners and advanced learners alike.
  - [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-lua) - Codecademy offers an interactive Lua course for learning through hands-on exercises and projects.


### REFLECT ON SLACK NEW LANGUAGE RESPONSES

I've had the opportunity to delve into the responses shared by fellow students this week, and it's been enlightening. While exploring Lua, I stumbled upon valuable insights shared by my peers, which deepened my understanding of the language. Moreover, I gained a comprehensive overview of other languages like Haskell and Processing through their posts. This process not only expanded my knowledge but also helped me identify additional resources beyond what I initially discovered. It's been a rewarding experience, and I look forward to further exploration.


### WRITE A USER STORY    

The app that I have chosen is Facebook because of its popularity among diverse user groups and its wide range of uses.

   - User Stories:

       1. As a student, I use Facebook to join local groups to find vacant rooms in the valley.
       2. As a job seeker, I use Facebook to join local communities to learn about those who are actively hiring.
       3. As a businessman, I use Facebook to join Marketplace groups for buy/sell purposes.
       4. As a student, I use Facebook to look for information on visa processing, Asian restaurants, etc.
       5. As a local, I use Facebook to get updates on upcoming events, job fairs.

   - Acceptance Criteria:

       1. Include a hashtag feature to indicate relevant locations, preferences, and event names.
       2. Implement upload features to allow users to upload images.
       3. Provide text fields for users to input and post content.
       4. Include a search field for users to easily find relevant information.
       5. Example of Acceptance Criteria:

   - Hashtagged posts should be searchable and clickable, leading to related content.
       1. Uploaded images should display correctly and be scalable for various screen sizes.
       2. Text fields should support a variety of characters and allow for basic formatting options.
       3. The search field should provide relevant results based on keywords and hashtags.


## Day 2 - 28th February 2024

### READ THE RESEARCH & REFLECTION ASSIGNMENT
Today, I spent time carefully reading the Research & Reflection Assignment. I learned what's expected and how my work will be judged from the assignment description and rubric. Understanding this helps me start the assignment in a structured and effective way.


### CHOOSE A LANGUAGE FOR COMMUNITY CODE
The language I would like to focus on for the community code project is JavaScript. I have years of experience using JavaScript, starting almost since my Higher National Diploma. Although my proficiency is at a basic level rather than advanced, I aim to utilize this opportunity to conduct thorough research on the language, improve my skills, and gain hands-on experience. One major reason why I chose JavaScript is because I believe that making weekly progress on the community project using this language will help me stay on track and learn about its complexity without giving up.
