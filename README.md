# Week 8 - Research and Reflection Journal

## Day 1 - 26th February 2024

### RESEARCH A NEW LANGUAGE

Lua is an embeddable scripting language and is popular for its powerful and lightweight features. Lua has been used in many industrial applications, such as Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom, and in embedded systems like the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil (Lua, 2024). Additionally, Lua is prominently featured in many famous games, such as World of Warcraft and Angry Birds. Lua also facilitates rapid modifications to basic systems, existing applications, or hardware (Stieg, 2022). Furthermore, Lua is increasingly used in network programming, such as in CISCO Systems, Nmap, and ModSecurity, to enhance overall performance and create advanced functionalities. It plays a major role in scripting tasks, including automation, file manipulation, and web scraping, often combined with other languages to  craft tailored applications  (Wambua, 2022).

There are many valuable online resources available for learning Lua. Some of my favorite websites include:

  - [Lua.org](https://www.lua.org/home.html) - Lua's official website, providing comprehensive documentation and resources.
  - [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/index.htm) - Tutorialspoint offers a detailed Lua tutorial covering various aspects of the language.
  - [Lua Learning](https://www.lualearning.org/) - Lua Learning organization provides interactive tutorials and resources for beginners and advanced learners alike.
  - [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-lua) - Codecademy offers an interactive Lua course for learning through hands-on exercises and projects.


### REFLECT ON SLACK NEW LANGUAGE RESPONSES

I've had the opportunity to delve into the responses shared by fellow students this week, and it's been enlightening. While exploring Lua, I stumbled upon valuable insights shared by my peers, which deepened my understanding of the language. Moreover, I gained a comprehensive overview of other languages like Haskell and Processing through their posts. This process not only expanded my knowledge but also helped me identify additional resources beyond what I initially discovered. It's been a rewarding experience, and I look forward to further exploration.

## Day 2 - 28th February 2024

### READ THE RESEARCH & REFLECTION ASSIGNMENT
Today, I spent time carefully reading the Research & Reflection Assignment. I learned what's expected and how my work will be judged from the assignment description and rubric. Understanding this helps me start the assignment in a structured and effective way.


### CHOOSE A LANGUAGE FOR COMMUNITY CODE
The language I would like to focus on for the community code project is JavaScript. I have years of experience using JavaScript, starting almost since my Higher National Diploma. Although my proficiency is at a basic level rather than advanced, I aim to utilize this opportunity to conduct thorough research on the language, improve my skills, and gain hands-on experience. One major reason why I chose JavaScript is because I believe that making weekly progress on the community project using this language will help me stay on track and learn about its complexity without giving up.

## Day 3 - 1st March 2024

### STAR GITHUB TOPICS AND REPOSITORIES OF INTEREST
While exploring my GitHub explorer tab, I noticed some repositories that caught my interest, such as ['tipjs/javascript-style-guide'](https://github.com/tipjs/javascript-style-guide) and ['ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript'](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript). Then, I explored the Topics tab and found more intriguing repositories like ['freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp'](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) and ['Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript'](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript), which I believe will help me achieve my goal of mastering JavaScript skills. Next, while browsing the trending section, I came across the repository ['LeCoupa/awesome-cheatsheets'](https://github.com/LeCoupa/awesome-cheatsheets), which offers useful JavaScript snippets for effective animation. After that, I checked the Collections tab and found the ['Front-end JavaScript frameworks'](https://github.com/collections/front-end-javascript-frameworks) collection, which aligns perfectly with my language preferences. Doing this helped me to fill my Explorer tab with some really interesting and valuable repositories.


## Day 4 - 2nd March 2024

### FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AND REFLECTIONS

1. What is one interesting thing that you’ve learned from researching about programming languages and from reading other students’ postings about programming languages in response to the first activity?

    - By researching programming languages, I discovered the differences between them and their unique features. Understanding these differences highlighted how choosing the appropriate language can significantly enhance the functionality of an application. Additionally, reading my classmates' postings about their chosen languages provided insight into how each individual perceives the importance of their selected language and how they base their choices on their skills and interests.

2. What other programming languages might you consider to work with for DGL 104? What are your second choices, and why?

    - While considering other programming languages for DGL 104, I was intrigued by the idea of working with newer languages like React Native or Kotlin. My second choice would have been React Native, as it offers cross-platform development capabilities. However, I decided against choosing these languages due to their novelty and the limited time available for in-depth research. Given the constraints of the project timeline, I opted to focus on a language with which I already had some familiarity to maximize productivity and learning outcomes.

3. What did you find most interesting when examining repositories on GitHub? Is there anything that surprised you, or that you didn’t expect? What similarities are there across some of the repositories you’ve starred?

    - Examining repositories on GitHub proved to be incredibly valuable. I was particularly fascinated by the diverse techniques and programming styles employed by different contributors. It was surprising to see how contributors collaboratively work on a single repository, demonstrating the value of teamwork in producing high-quality outputs. Moreover, I observed similarities across some of the repositories, such as the use of modular code structures, comprehensive documentation, and active community engagement. 


# Week 9 - Research and Reflection Journal

## Day 5 - 05th March 2024

### READ THE COMMUNITY CODE ASSIGNMENT

In reading the information about the community code project, I found that we should focus on contributing to an open-source project and writing code. I really like how the assignment is structured because it's only about writing code for one of them. Additionally, I understand the different coding contributions that I have to make, such as using a programming language and another using a markup language.

For Part 1 of the assignment, the focus is on contributing to a real open-source community. I feel that, for this purpose, I would be more willing to use approaches like improving code documentation, writing a code tutorial, or working on translations. These would be the best choices for me to contribute. The major reason for choosing these instead of writing code or answering community questions is because I am still at a basic level, and I will not be able to do my best with the limited time available for those tasks.

For Part 2, I understand that I have to make my contributions to the DGL 104 pattern library repository. I will be applying my coding skills to this section with a focus on design patterns. After looking at the rubrics, I feel they are pretty clear, and a good grade can be achieved by following them. I also appreciate the structured categorization in the rubrics, which helps to focus on achieving the highest grade.


### READ THE RESEARCH AND REFLECTION GUIDE

I read the 'Research and Reflection Journal Guide', which was very helpful for me in understanding the lecturer's expectations. Initially, I completed my work using a different structure. However, after reading the 'Research and Reflection Journal Guide', I found a much better method to structure my journal. It also helped me identify the tense of language that I should use when writing it.


## Day 6 - 07th March 2024

### READ “HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN SOURCE”

#### Summary

By reading the [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/) guide, I gained an understanding of the underlying reasons why people contribute to open source and how contributing serves as a means to learn and develop hands-on experience. The guide also provided insights into becoming an open-source contributor, the types of individuals involved in an open-source project, and the various types of documentation (e.g., license, README, contributing, etc.) associated with a repository. Furthermore, it offers detailed explanations about the tools utilized in an open-source project to organize discussions. Additionally, the guide shed light on different effective ways to find a project to contribute to, offering a useful pre-made checklist to assess whether a project is suitable for accepting contributions. It also outlines various methods to submit contributions, including communication practices, performing a quick check on the README file, identifying appropriate situations to open an issue, the accurate way to open a pull request, and the post-submission process.

Exploring the "What it means to contribute" section, I learned that contributing to open source isn't solely about coding, contrary to what I believed over the past year. I was able to identify highly effective ways to contribute to the code, such as:

1. Organizing the project’s conference
2. Restructuring layouts to enhance the project’s usability
3. Writing and improving the project’s documentation (which I personally enjoy doing)
4. Translating the project’s documentation
5. Linking to duplicate issues and suggesting new issue labels, among other methods.

Moreover, the "Finding a project to contribute to" section helped me understand how to leverage the repositories I typically use or find anything interesting. It also emphasized the significance of small contributions, such as correcting a typo or updating areas for improvement. Additionally, it introduced valuable resources like [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore/), [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/), and [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/) for discovering projects that are best for contribution.

#### Reflection

Upon reading the "How to Contribute to Open Source" guide, I gained a clear understanding of the appropriate approach needed to engage with community code projects. Utilizing its insights, my initial plan involves using the checklist to identify a repository that aligns with my level of knowledge and expertise. Subsequently, I aim to employ various strategies such as drafting project documentation, providing translations, creating tutorials, and addressing issues such as duplicates and typos for contributing to the community.

### FIND POTENTIAL PROJECTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO

- Task 1

    I visited three websites, Good First Issue, Up for Grabs, and CodeTriage, and conducted searches specifically for projects based on JavaScript. Utilizing filtering options such as language and labels such as documentation, good first issue, and help wanted proved instrumental in identifying the most suitable projects to focus on for this assignment. As a result of these searches, I discovered numerous projects aligned with my interests and areas where I aim to contribute.

- Task 2

    Below is the list of three projects/repositories that I am interested in contributing to:

    01. One repository that has captured my attention the most is [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/). It is specifically designed to assist beginners in making their first contributions to open-source projects.  This repository is highly active, boasting over 5000 contributors and offering many language translations. Currently, there are about 16 active issues and 465 pull requests.

### EXPLORE COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS

First, I delved into the community connections of [Teammates](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/) and discovered that they do not utilize messaging platforms or other typical environments for community engagement. Instead, they encourage users to post messages directly into their [issue tracker](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/issues/new).

Next, I explored [Activist](https://github.com/activist-org/) and found that they offer a dedicated Community space for individuals involved with and utilizing activist.org. This space comprises four distinct rooms and areas:

1. **LocalizationSuggested**: Discussion area focusing on activist's copy and its localization, accessible at https://crowdin.com/project/activist.
   
2. **GeneralSuggested**: The primary room for the activist.org community to engage in diverse discussions, share ideas, and exchange news.
   
3. **DevelopmentSuggested**: Platform for discussions centered around the development of activist, located at https://github.com/activist-org/activist.
   
4. **Inspiration**: Repository of links to resources that could serve as inspiration for the design or development of activist.

Lastly, I investigated [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/) and noted that they provide a link to join their Slack team for assistance or inquiries via https://firstcontributors.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-29qhyr9lt-Bi7WLbgGIFqV7aCEG_grvg#/shared-invite/error. However, it seems that the provided link is currently inaccessible or broken.
