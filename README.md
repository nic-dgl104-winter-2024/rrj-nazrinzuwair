# Week 8 - Research and Reflection Journal

## Day 1 - 26th February 2024

### RESEARCH A NEW LANGUAGE

Lua is an embeddable scripting language and is popular for its powerful and lightweight features. Lua has been used in many industrial applications, such as Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom, and in embedded systems like the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil (Lua, 2024). Additionally, Lua is prominently featured in many famous games, such as World of Warcraft and Angry Birds. Lua also facilitates rapid modifications to basic systems, existing applications, or hardware (Stieg, 2022). Furthermore, Lua is increasingly used in network programming, such as in CISCO Systems, Nmap, and ModSecurity, to enhance overall performance and create advanced functionalities. It plays a major role in scripting tasks, including automation, file manipulation, and web scraping, often combined with other languages to  craft tailored applications  (Wambua, 2022).

There are many valuable online resources available for learning Lua. Some of my favorite websites include:

  - [Lua.org](https://www.lua.org/home.html) - Lua's official website, providing comprehensive documentation and resources.
  - [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/index.htm) - Tutorialspoint offers a detailed Lua tutorial covering various aspects of the language.
  - [Lua Learning](https://www.lualearning.org/) - Lua Learning organization provides interactive tutorials and resources for beginners and advanced learners alike.
  - [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-lua) - Codecademy offers an interactive Lua course for learning through hands-on exercises and projects.


### REFLECT ON SLACK NEW LANGUAGE RESPONSES

I've had the opportunity to delve into the responses shared by fellow students this week, and it's been enlightening. While exploring Lua, I stumbled upon valuable insights shared by my peers, which deepened my understanding of the language. Moreover, I gained a comprehensive overview of other languages like Haskell and Processing through their posts. This process not only expanded my knowledge but also helped me identify additional resources beyond what I initially discovered. It's been a rewarding experience, and I look forward to further exploration.


### WRITE A USER STORY

## Day 2 - 28th February 2024

### READ THE RESEARCH & REFLECTION ASSIGNMENT
Today, I spent time carefully reading the Research & Reflection Assignment. I learned what's expected and how my work will be judged from the assignment description and rubric. Understanding this helps me start the assignment in a structured and effective way.


### CHOOSE A LANGUAGE FOR COMMUNITY CODE
The language I would like to focus on for the community code project is JavaScript. I have years of experience using JavaScript, starting almost since my Higher National Diploma. Although my proficiency is at a basic level rather than advanced, I aim to utilize this opportunity to conduct thorough research on the language, improve my skills, and gain hands-on experience. One major reason why I chose JavaScript is because I believe that making weekly progress on the community project using this language will help me stay on track and learn about its complexity without giving up.

## Day 3 - 1st March 2024

### STAR GITHUB TOPICS AND REPOSITORIES OF INTEREST
While exploring my GitHub explorer tab, I noticed some repositories that caught my interest, such as ['tipjs/javascript-style-guide'](https://github.com/tipjs/javascript-style-guide) and ['ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript'](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript). Then, I explored the Topics tab and found more intriguing repositories like ['freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp'](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) and ['Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript'](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript), which I believe will help me achieve my goal of mastering JavaScript skills. Next, while browsing the trending section, I came across the repository ['LeCoupa/awesome-cheatsheets'](https://github.com/LeCoupa/awesome-cheatsheets), which offers useful JavaScript snippets for effective animation. After that, I checked the Collections tab and found the ['Front-end JavaScript frameworks'](https://github.com/collections/front-end-javascript-frameworks) collection, which aligns perfectly with my language preferences. Doing this helped me to fill my Explorer tab with some really interesting and valuable repositories.


## Day 4 - 2nd March 2024

### FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AND REFLECTIONS

1. What is one interesting thing that you’ve learned from researching about programming languages and from reading other students’ postings about programming languages in response to the first activity?

    - By researching programming languages, I discovered the differences between them and their unique features. Understanding these differences highlighted how choosing the appropriate language can significantly enhance the functionality of an application. Additionally, reading my classmates' postings about their chosen languages provided insight into how each individual perceives the importance of their selected language and how they base their choices on their skills and interests.

2. What other programming languages might you consider to work with for DGL 104? What are your second choices, and why?

    - While considering other programming languages for DGL 104, I was intrigued by the idea of working with newer languages like React Native or Kotlin. My second choice would have been React Native, as it offers cross-platform development capabilities. However, I decided against choosing these languages due to their novelty and the limited time available for in-depth research. Given the constraints of the project timeline, I opted to focus on a language with which I already had some familiarity to maximize productivity and learning outcomes.

3. What did you find most interesting when examining repositories on GitHub? Is there anything that surprised you, or that you didn’t expect? What similarities are there across some of the repositories you’ve starred?

    - Examining repositories on GitHub proved to be incredibly valuable. I was particularly fascinated by the diverse techniques and programming styles employed by different contributors. It was surprising to see how contributors collaboratively work on a single repository, demonstrating the value of teamwork in producing high-quality outputs. Moreover, I observed similarities across some of the repositories, such as the use of modular code structures, comprehensive documentation, and active community engagement. 


# Week 9 - Research and Reflection Journal

## Day 5 - 05th March 2024

### READ THE COMMUNITY CODE ASSIGNMENT

In reading the information about the community code project, I found that we should focus on contributing to an open-source project and writing code. I really like how the assignment is structured because it's only about writing code for one of them. Additionally, I understand the different coding contributions that I have to make, such as using a programming language and another using a markup language.

For Part 1 of the assignment, the focus is on contributing to a real open-source community. I feel that, for this purpose, I would be more willing to use approaches like improving code documentation, writing a code tutorial, or working on translations. These would be the best choices for me to contribute. The major reason for choosing these instead of writing code or answering community questions is because I am still at a basic level, and I will not be able to do my best with the limited time available for those tasks.

For Part 2, I understand that I have to make my contributions to the DGL 104 pattern library repository. I will be applying my coding skills to this section with a focus on design patterns. After looking at the rubrics, I feel they are pretty clear, and a good grade can be achieved by following them. I also appreciate the structured categorization in the rubrics, which helps to focus on achieving the highest grade.


### READ THE RESEARCH AND REFLECTION GUIDE

I read the 'Research and Reflection Journal Guide', which was very helpful for me in understanding the lecturer's expectations. Initially, I completed my work using a different structure. However, after reading the 'Research and Reflection Journal Guide', I found a much better method to structure my journal. It also helped me identify the tense of language that I should use when writing it.
